cc 2017-19 Scott Smallwood

This software was developed in Max 7 for MacOS, and requires several data files, including climate data, sound files, and video files (included).

Higher-resolution video file are available from the composer/author.

Note:  the sound is 4-channel, but can be played in stereo mode (click on stereo switch).  
By default, stereo is routed to dac 1 and 2.
The 4-channel audio is routed to dac 3, 4, 5, 6 (offset by two for MOTU).

This software is part of a installation called Macromareal: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats, in collaboration with visual artist Sydney Lancaster.  The piece was first exhibited at Main & Station in Paarsboro, NS.
